# Data tools

In the short term, we are likely to get access to murky data sources.
It behooves us to locate, document, or even create tools that can
process poorly-formatted government data into better-formatted data.
We can then serve a (temporary) roll in proxying end-user requests,
passing the state data through our filters.

In the medium and long term, we can hopefully push these tools to the
state, and have them deliver high quality data directly to users.

You can help this project by adding information here
1. clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:Travis4nh/open-gov-data-init.git`
1. edit the file `data_tools.md` to include new information
1. `git add ; git commit -m"added a data source" ; git push origin`
